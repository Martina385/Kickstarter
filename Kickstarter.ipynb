    "Mr. Brain invented a Meme Master Memory (a memory game with videos/gifs) and needs money for the implementation. He wants to do the project in 4 weeks, wants to get 100,000USD and wants to launch the campaign in summertime in the category photography.\n",
    "Under these circumstances, will the project be successful? Furthermore we want to recommend Mr. Brain different improvements to increase his chance for success. In addition we also want to predict his potential pledged amount. "

    "* Business Understanding:\n",
    "    * Kickstarter is a Crowdfunding website that enables entrepreneurs to fund money for their business ideas.\n",
    "    * With regard to our business case we are looking for the features that might be relavant for the success of the project, especially with regard to the characteristics of our stakeholders project (e.g., product category, season) \n",
    "    * Evaluation metrics: It is in our stakeholders interest that we are confident in our prediction of success and that we avoid the case that our stakeholder puts a lot of effort in a project that is likely to fail. In other words we want to avoid a false positive prediction and that is why we choose precision as our main evlaution metric.\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "* Data Collection \n",
    "    * For our data analysis and modeling we use a well known kaggle dataset. Our data science bootcamp teachers gave us the dataset but similar datasets can be found online.\n",

    "<br/> \n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "* Predictive Modeling\n",
    "    * We will use a simple logistic regression, SVM and random forest to predict the success of the project. The classification models can be found in the Jupyter Notebook \"Kickstarter\"\n",
    "    * For the prediciton of the total amount that the stakeholder could pledge we use a polynomial regression, random forest and Adaboost. This is still work in progess. First models do not show a reasonable fit and further analyses might be needed.\n",
